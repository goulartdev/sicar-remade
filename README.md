# Sicar Remade

**Under developemnt**

This project is a demonstration of how cloud-native geospatial technologies could be applied to [Sicar](https://consultapublica.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index), a Brazilian farms Ataset.

The idea is to use PMTiles stored in a S3 compatible bucket to provide vizualisation-optmized data to the frontend.
